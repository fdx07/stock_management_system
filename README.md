# stock_management_system
This project includes a basic stock management system that is going to be further developed and enhanced by the time.


FIRST VERSION

Firstly, the code creates a text file for storing stock data.

Then, it provides six options:

1- Add Product: You can add products to your stock system using this option. If you add data for an already existing product, the system detects it and increments the quantity for that product.

2- Update Product: You can update the quantity of your products using this option. If the product doesn't exist, the system adds it as a new product to the data file.

3- View Stock: This option allows you to display your stock data in a tabular format on the terminal. It utilizes the PrettyTable library for this purpose.

4- Sell Product: You can sell products by choosing this option. You need to provide the product name and the quantity you want to sell. The system checks if the available stock is sufficient and completes the sale. If the quantity exceeds the available stock, a warning message is displayed.

5- Delete Product: You can use this option to delete a specific product from your stock records.

6- Exit: Choosing this option allows you to exit the system.
